# DS_Utils
DS_Utils is my own homebrew solution to a Roblox DataStore wrapper, its pretty basic can be comined with other scripts for more functionality.

included:
GetPlayerIdFromNameAsync wrapper
UpdateAsync wrapper
RemoveAsync wrapper
Caching for returned data

# Usage
use this however you'd like from copying to modifying and using it in a game, if you want you can credit my although that'll never be required

# Documentation
TBD (if you see this pre-documentation, I'll add it in a day or two but the config module script should be able to explain how to set it up I believe)
